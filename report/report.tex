    this is a reference \cite{HRSL-dataset}

    this is a reference \cite{grid3-dataset}

    \section{Motivation}
    Here we want to identify, define and delimit a problem within information technology.

    \lipsum[1-1]

    \section{Introduction}
    Here we want to identify and analyse relevant means for solving the problem, such as academic theories, methods, literature, tools and other sources, as well as existing solutions to the problem.

    \lipsum[1-1]

    \section{Methods}
    Here we want to combine the selected means, develop them further if necessary, and apply them in a concerted effort towards the solution of the problem.

    \lipsum[1-1]

    \section{Results}
    Here we want to evaluate the achieved solution.

    \lipsum[1-1]

    \section{Discussion}
    Here we want to report in a coherent and stringent way the problem, the background research, the work towards the solution, the achieved solution, the evaluation, and other relevant material, while adhering to the academic standards.
    Also, we want to reflect upon the problem, the chosen approach, the achieved solution, and other findings.
